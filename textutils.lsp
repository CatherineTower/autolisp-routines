;; Written by Catherine Tower while she was working at Baye Enterprises
;; these utilities are meant specifically for the Baye environment and
;; may malfunction under any other circumstances

;; These replace the TEXT and MLEADER commands with commands that set
;; the layer before creating the object

;;   (subst (cons 8 newlayername) (assoc 8 entitydata) entitydata)

(command ".undefine" "mleader")

  (setvar "clayer" "text")
  (command ".mleader" pause pause "")
  (command ".textedit" (entlast))
  (setvar "clayer" oldlayer)
