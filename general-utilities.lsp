;; AutoLISP is what I'm going to call a "degenerate Lisp". A lot of
;; the standard functions you expect from an implementation of Lisp
;; aren't included. This file aims to bridge the gap between a "proper
;; Lisp" (Common Lisp, Scheme) and AutoLISP.

;; I don't hardly use most of these, but first and rest are a necessity.
