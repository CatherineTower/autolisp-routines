AutoLISP Routines
===========================================================================

This repository is meant to hold utility functions and useful commands
written in AutoLISP for Baye Enterprises. The routines themselves are
open-source and free to be used for any purpose whatsoever. That being
said, you probably won't find much use for them if you're not working
at Baye Enterprises.

Usage
===========================================================================

Get the Files

  Using Git
    Clone the Git repository with the following command:
    $ git clone https://GitHub.com/CatherineTower/autolisp-routines.git

  In a ZIP File
    Download a zipped archive of the files using GitHub. The button
    should be located in the top right hand corner of the
    webpage. Once the file has downloaded, decompress the archive.

Load the Files

  In a running instance of AutoCAD, run the `APPLOAD` command to bring
  up the "Load/Unload Applications" window. Navigate to the location
  where you saved the repository and select the files you want loaded.

  Note that there are currently dependencies, so it's safest to load
  all of the files together.

Add the Files to Your Load Path [Optional]

  In the "Load/Unload Applications" window, there's a panel which says
  "Startup Suite". This is the list of AutoCAD programs which are
  loaded at application startup. Click "Contents", then "Add" to add
  the AutoLISP files to your load path.

Invoke the Commands

  Any function prepended by a C: is a runnable command (i.e. C:mleader
  is the command MLEADER). These commands can be invoked in the usual
  way. Other functions have to be enclosed in parentheses and have any
  arguments they take passed to them. If you're not sure how to handle
  that, it's probably better to stick to the standard un-parenthesized
  commands.

All commands were written and tested by Catherine Tower unless
otherwise specified.
