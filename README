AutoLISP Routines
===========================================================================

This repository is meant to hold utility functions and useful commands
written in AutoLISP for Baye Enterprises. The routines themselves are
open-source and free to be used for any purpose whatsoever. That being
said, you probably won't find much use for them if you're not working
at Baye Enterprises.

All commands were written and tested by Catherine Tower unless
otherwise specified.
